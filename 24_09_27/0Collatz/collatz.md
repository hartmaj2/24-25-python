# Collatz problem
- We create numbers in order by using the collatz rules:
  - pick your favorite number
  - repeat forever:
    - if 1 - finish (break)
    - if even - divide by 2
    - if odd - multiply by 3 and add 1

- We don't know, if this procedure has to always end. Maybe there is a number for which it goes infinitely!
- Try for number 64, try for 7
