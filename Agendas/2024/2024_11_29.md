## Main goal

- show that multiple lists works but has downsides
- classes are good but we will explain later

- godot - what is it?

- game engines
  - what is a game engine?
  - why should we want to use a game engine?
    - level design
    - built in physics
  - examples of game engines?

## 0. Riddle - lists linked just by agreement

- when having multiple lists connected in our own mind, the program will not enforce it
- when we do something with one list, we may forget what to do with other list
  - sorting
  - deleting
- when we have small program, it is ok; for big program we might forget to do all things that are necessary!

## 1. Introduction to game engines and Godot

- show what is the best thing about game engine -> visual editor, tilesets, physics

- introduce godot on simple platformer game
- hero will be able to jump on platforms, will die if falls
