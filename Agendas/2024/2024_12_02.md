## Main goal

- learn more in Godot
- importing a project from github
- try signals in godot
- bigger map and make camera follow player
- type annotations
- exercise -> advent of code

## 0. Riddle - setting velocity/speed when pressing both keys + just_pressed()

- idea1: challenges that many programmers had to face are usually already implemented somewhere
- idea2: the solution is great to use when you don't need custom behavior (faster in one direction e.g)

## 1. Type annotations - why are they useful?

- pro: 
  - prevents us from making stupid mistakes
  - we don't release a game that suddenly crashes
- contra: takes more time to write the code

- important connected concept: syntax error vs semantic/logical error

## 2. Godot - make enemies with preset paths and collisions
