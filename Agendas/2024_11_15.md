## Ideas

- show how decomposition can be slow in python 
  - can be used in rock paper scissors
    - rock - 2 primes
    - paper - 3 primes
    - scissors - 4 primes
- show how it is faster in python when not creating additional variable
  - 25 seconds without variable, 30 seconds with it
- show how it is faster in c++ about 50 times

- show scissors program that always cheats
  - can we somehow overcome this problem?
- implement a version that uses prime to prove it is not cheating
