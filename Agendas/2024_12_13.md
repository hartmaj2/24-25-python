## Main goals

- developing algorithms
  - finding maximum
  - solving KSP problem
- thinking about how fasts algorithms are
  - sorting algorithms

## 1. Developing our own sorting algorithm

- first start with revising the csfieldguide simulation [link](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/sorting-algorithms/)
- how can we rewrite the algorithm of selecting the maximum into python?

## 2. Solivng KSP problem - an easy one (maybe the one on dictionary)

- the problem [link](https://ksp.mff.cuni.cz/z/ulohy/36/zadani1.html#task-36-Z1-1)
- they will have to log in

## 3. Introduction to making games with Pygame

- pip3 install pygame
