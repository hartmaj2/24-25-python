## Main goals

- introduce pygame - motivation
  - show main concepts 
    - boilerplate code
    - game loop
    - input: events, key press detection, mouse
    - sprites: surfaces, rectangles

- optional: solve another ksp problem (or more)

## 0. Riddle - data type checking

- some languages have strict data types by default: C#, C++, Java, Godot
- python has dymanic typing - you don't have to tell what kind of data type you will store in the variable ahead of time
  - but we have data annotation
- we have tools that help us make less errors - type checkers:
  - Pylance -> `"python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic"`
    - options: `off`,`basic`,`strict`
- what is the advantage of not having type checking and having it?

## 1. Pygame intro

## 2. KSP problem
