## Main goal 

- introduce recursion (what the heck is it?)
- writing code as short as possible
- learning with pygame
  - reading documentation
  - working with ChatGPT

## 0. Riddle - code with recursion

- program that will print "hello" multiple times

## 1. Practice - what Gauss did as a kid

- do they know Gauss?
  - he was smart mathematician
  - used to annoy teachers because he solved everything too fast

- to make him amused teacher gave him task to sum up 1 + 2 + ... + 100
  - how much is that?

- try to write as short code as possible to solve the riddle above!

- show them that recursion can be used to solve it
- but the best way is to be smart mathematician!
  - explain how we can get the formula for the sum

## 2. More pygame - working with ChatGPT and documentation

- installing pygame module 
  - python3 -m pip install pygame <- to install
  - then will need to restart vscode <- for highlighting

- game ideas:
  - cookie clicker
  - t-rex jumper
  - space invader
  - pexeso

- try to program a game using ChatGPT
- how to use documentation
