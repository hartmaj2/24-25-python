## Main goals

- show why classes useful
- geometry 
  - angles, tan/atan, sin, cos etc.
- work on the zombie shooter game

## 0. Riddle

TODO: come up with a riddle

## 1. Zombie shooter game

### 1.0 Plan

- character movement
  - arrow controls
  - pointing towards mouse pointer
- zombies
  - spawning in time intervals at different locations
  - following player
  - dealing damage to player
- shooting in direction of mouse pointer

### 1.1 Player movement

- move using wasd
- set player speed -> show clock with fps (why is it useful)
- normalize player speed
  - good way: use dx,dy ; find length ; if not zero divide by the length
- rotate player towards the mouse pointer - use atan2 function 
  - how does sin, atan, tan works
  - how radians work and how to convert to degrees
  - use atan2 function -> atan would only work for one direction


### 1.2 Zombie movement

- move towards player
- calculate x,y distances 
  - how to get how we should move on x axis and y axis when we know rotation?

### 1.3 Bonus

- how to fix the axis of rotation of the player
  - so far the center of the image rotates but we want the center of the player to rotate
