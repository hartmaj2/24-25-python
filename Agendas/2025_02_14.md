## 1. Continuation of zombie shooter

- revise what we did
  - what are rects?
  - what is game clock and why do we need it?

- improvements:
  - make player not be able to leave the world
  - make player diagonal speed normalized
    - trick with using dx,dy which are UNIT so we can divide by them most of the time without anything happening
    - when the distance is sqrt(2) then dividing both dx and dy by it will make it the right length
  - test rotation using arrow keys (use events)
