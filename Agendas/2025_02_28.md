## Main goal

- simulating multiple simple events to calculate probability
- plotting graphs of multiple assembled values inside a list

## 1. Probability of passing through Crypt

- link to rule here: [link](../25_02_28/1TalismanSimulation/crypt.png)
- setting: 
  - your hero has ability with level n
- goal: 
  - pass through the crypt
- procedure:
  - you roll three dice
  - if the dice rolled less than or equal to your ability, you can stay
  - otherwise when you subtract your power, the number will be positive -> it will teleport you away

- what we would you expect the probability of passing be when the ability is at:
  - 18 -> 100%
  - 10 -> 50%
  - 7 -> 25%
  - 5 -> 10%

## 2. Maringale

- try in real life with poker coins 
- I bet n coins
- if I roll 5 or 6 I win back my bet and n of your coins, otherwise, you get my bet
- play around 20 rounds and see what happens, my starting bet will be 1, my starting money 1000

- is this a good strategy overall?
- lets simulate this on our computer!
