# 14.3.2025

## Goal

- finish poker exercise
- learn more about working with classes in python

## 0. Using standard type checking

- show what it does (how it helps)

- example: (what is wrong with the code below?)
```py
a = "a"
b = 1
a > b
```

- try the code above with different settings in `settings.json` using `"python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "choice",` where choice can be:
  - off
  - basic
  - standard
  - strict

## 1. Defining behavior of operators of our class

- `==` : `__eq__(self,other)` (EQual)
- `<` : `__lt__(self,other)` (Lower Than)
- `<=` : `__le__(self,other)` (Lower or Equal)
- `>` : `__gt__(self,other)` (Greater Than)
- `>=` : `__ge__(self,other)` (Greater or Equal)

- this is useful because now python uses the `__lt__()` method for sorting

## 2. (OPTIONAL) Create a deck of cards and shuffle it, then sort it
