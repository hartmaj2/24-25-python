## Main goals

- do something simple to raise motivation
  - Fibonacci sequence

## 0. Fibonacci sequence exercise

- we have the following setting
  - invincible rabbits
  - in year 0, we have 0 rabbit pairs
  - in year 1, we buy young 1 rabbit pair
  - each next year happens the following:
    - each young rabbit pair grows to an old rabbit pair
    - each old rabbit pair produces another old rabbit pair

- compare different algorithms (introduce timing module)
  - recursive
  - generating an array
  - using two integers
  - explicit formula

- BONUS: use matplotlib to plot different functions compared to fibonacci sequence
  - exponential series
  - arithmetic sequence

## 1. Maybe some data anaylisis example

- show basics of html for data scraping?
  - quickly learn with beautiful soap

- find some interesting data to scrape, get

- introduce matplotlib plotting


## 2. Continue working on poker

- implement checking pairs, triples and quads
