# 2.5.2025

## Main goal

- show cryptography example with symmetric vs asymmetric cryptography advantage (five parties that don't trust each other)
- finish poker program (at least be able to compare different combinations, not necessarily compare two same type combinations)
- work on webpage 
  - add possibility to run poker program by pasting the input to a input box and getting the result in another box

## 0. Cryptography example

## 1. Improving poker program

- how can we use buckets to detect a pair?

- is there a better way to implement functions for checking - pair,triple,quadruple?

- after finishing the main components, it is good to check

## 2. Testing probabilities of certain combinations

- if we wanted to know how often the combinations occur, how could we test that?
