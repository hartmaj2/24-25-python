## Main goals

- finish scraping program
  - scrape the data we want to test
  - print the data (to see if we scraped correctly)
  - implement the game using the data

## 0. Getting the data part

- use Beautiful Soup to collect data from the table
  - locate the right table 
    - use BS find all tables
    - possibly with class attribute value passed as dict
    - then find the correct table by trial and error
  - use BS to get all rows in the table
  - implement a for loop over all rows
  - get correct data from correct column in each row
    - trial and error or inspect the html in browser

- create class for the data
  - why? 
    - easy to work with the data in the future
    - each data entry can be viewed as an object (Country,Player,Person)
    - each object has its attributes
      - Country - name, capital_city, population
      - Player - name, team, nationality, goals
      - Person - name, nationality, net_worth
  - in our game, we will be able to manipulate with those objects easily
  - BONUS NOTE:
    - in this example, the classes will not have any behavior since they're values are not changing
    - but possibly, in some computer game, we would be able to change the amount of goals, change population etc.
