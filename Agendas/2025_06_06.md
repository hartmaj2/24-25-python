# Agenda 6.6.2025

## Main goal

- fix player guessing games

- show how passing functions work

## 1. Fix scraping game (maintainability)

- can he find a mistake in the second version of his player guessing game?

- why did the mistake happen?
  - can he think of other scenarios where a similar mistake might happen?
    - what if he wants to change the way that the game talks to the player?
    - or add a limit to the number of rounds?
    - change time of waiting

- does he have any idea how to avoid this problem?
  - identify what code repeats
  - what code is different?
    - can we pass that code into the function?

- show example of passing function to another function

## 2. Fix scraping game (separation of concerns)

- there are two main parts of the program that have very different tasks
- can he identify them?

- getting data vs using the data
  - good habit to make parts that have different concerns separated from each other

- bonus:
  - create variable for amount of time towait 

## 3. Fix player guesser game (make code shorter inside player)

- see following [example](../25_06_06/0Examples/0a_shorter_if.py)

## 4. Fix player guesser game (make code shorter inside )
