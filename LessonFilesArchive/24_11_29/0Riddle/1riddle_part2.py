# Is there 

items = ["sword","shield","helmet","staff"]
item_costs = [10,5,20,4]
item_powers = [23,10,4,5]

# 1. We decide to remove helmet from the items
items.remove("helmet")

# 2. Now we want to see the price of the most expensive item in the shop
# HOW WOULD WE CODE THIS USING item_costs and one helper variable? (I know it will be wrong since we didn't remove from item_costs but for exercise)
