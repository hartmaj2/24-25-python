# Ideas to improve lessons or for interesting topics

## Teaching style improvements

- show equivalent Scratch code to corresponding python code for new concepts and especially at the start of the course

## Copy ideas from my phone notes here
- Learning resources
- Find a developer road map - for self-motivated kids

## Interesting topics

- calculating how many magic squares out of possible squares valuated with numbers {1,...,9}
  
- using python for interesting tasks:
  - autoclicking (auto mouse drag)
  - sending mails

- use ChatGPT api (or some other ai)

- make programs with UI (clickable elements, textboxes etc.)

## Todo

- find better game dev module than pygame
  - somewhere, where image manipulation simple (rotating image etc.)
  - maybe pyglet?

- research possible competitions, tutorials etc. that I could recommend to kids
